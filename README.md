# Playground

Playground is just my personal site to make proof of concept and test some new features that i'm considering add to some project or i just find them great.


## Setup instructions

I recommend don't use them :P
Each folder is a test and i try to keep codes well commented.
Never know when gonna be usefull for anyone.

## Requirements
	Requirements depends on each test.

## Tests

* neo4j

Neo4J is a test for the neo4j api in nodejs.
You need a `neo4j database` (i'm using 1.7 on windows) to use this test and node-neo4j

	npm install neo4j

* mocha

Mocha is a BDD/TDD test framework
You need `mocha` framework and maybe `should` if i finally intregate it.

    npm install -g mocha

* coffee-script

Here i'm testing out `coffee-script` potential with `nodeJS` and `express` so you gonna need to install them

	npm install -g coffee-script
	npm install express@2.5.9
	npm install jade

Jade is just optional but i gonna remake my express-boilerplate in coffeescript to test my skills on it

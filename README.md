# Playground

Playground is just my personal site to make proof of concept and test some new features that i'm considering add to some project or i just find them great.


## Setup instructions

I recommend don't use them :P
Each folder is a test and i try to keep codes well commented.
Never know when gonna be usefull for anyone.

## Requirements
	Requirements depends on each test.
